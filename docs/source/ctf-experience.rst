2. CTFs Experience
==============================
Stumbled upon CTFs and fell in love with them. Credits to my friend sr for introducing me to CTFs! I enjoy the process of tearing things down and digging things out. Ultimately 
just to find a flag. Am I silly? nope i disagree, this is my hobby. 

CTF comps I have participated in:

- UIUCTF 2024

- Grey Cat The Flag 2024 Qualifier Round 

- BrainHack â€” Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp 2024 Qualifier Round

- picoCTF 2024

- HackBash x A.YCEP 2024 Final Round

- HackBash x A.YCEP 2024 Qualifier Round 

I will add a URL to the writeups for future ctf challenges once i get better at it.

As I am not a master at CTFs, usually I read writeups from other people to learn the approaches they take to address various challenges. I am 
amazed at their wits and calm mindset and hope I can be like them 1 day ! Else usually I practice CTFs on picoCTF
