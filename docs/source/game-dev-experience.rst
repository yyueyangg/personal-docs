3. Game Development Experience
===============================
This are just some games I coded using Python Pygame and Tkinter. I learnt Python through self-learning. So, I learnt to create
these games to try and apply what I have learnt. Also, these games are not built from scratch, I learnt them from other people's code
and writeups, but modified them to add in my own elements. So please do credit them too!

And this is also why I am not the most perfect game developers who use C# or Unity. But well, Im doing my best!

Environment Setup:
You will have to install the latest version Pygame, Tkinter, NumPy, random, math, sys. 

Pygame is not available on MacOS. If you are developing on MacOS, you will need a VM or a Boot Camp Assistant.
